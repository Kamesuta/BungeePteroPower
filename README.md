BungeePteroPower is a plugin that can automatically start/stop servers based on the number of players.  
It can start and stop servers on the [Pterodactyl panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) when players join or leave the Bungeecord proxy server.  
This helps to save server resources and manage servers more efficiently.

## Key Features

- Automatically stops servers using Pterodactyl's API when there are no players on the server for a certain period of time.
    - The time until shutdown can be configured for each server.
- Automatically starts servers using Pterodactyl's API when players join the server.
- Permissions settings allow for specifying players who can manually start servers and players for whom automatic startup is enabled upon joining.
- You can reset the server from a backup when it shuts down.
    - This is useful when creating mini-game servers that reset once played.

## Download

- You can download it from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%A1-bungeepteropower-%E2%9A%A1-start-stop-servers-when-player-join-leave.114883/) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Kamesuta/BungeePteroPower/releases).

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
    - uses `java.net.http.HttpClient` in Java 11 for REST API communication with Pterodactyl.

## Getting Started

1. Obtain an API key in the Pterodactyl panel.
    - The client API key for Pterodactyl can be found in the "API Credentials" tab on the account page.
2. Add the plugin to the BungeeCord server and start it.
3. Configure the [Required Settings](#required-settings) in the generated `plugins/BungeePteroPower/config.yml` file.
    ```yml
    # Pterodactyl configuration
    pterodactyl:
      # The URL of your pterodactyl panel
      # If you use Cloudflare Tunnel, you need to allow the ip in the bypass setting.
      url: "https://panel.example.com"
      # The client api key of your pterodactyl panel. It starts with "ptlc_".
      # You can find the client api key in the "API Credentials" tab of the "Account" page.
      apiKey: "ptlc_000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    
    # Per server configuration
    servers:
      pvp:
        # Pterodactyl server ID
        # You can find the Pterodactyl server ID in the URL of the server page.
        # For example, if the URL is https://panel.example.com/server/1234abcd, the server ID is 1234abcd.
        id: 1234abcd
        # The time in seconds to stop the server after the last player leaves.
        # If you don't want to stop the server automatically, set it to -1.
        # If you set it to 0, the server will be stopped immediately after the last player leaves.
        timeout: 30
    ```
4. Reload the config with the `/ptero reload` command.
5. Configure the [Permission Settings](#permission-settings).  
    (You **MUST** configure permission to use this plugin, otherwise the player will not be able to do anything!)  
    You can use either of the following methods.  
    - Use a permission plugin like [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).
        1. For LuckPerms, use the following commands to set permissions:
            ```
            # The player can start all servers
            /lp user <player_name> permission set ptero.autostart.*
            # The player can start specific server
            /lp user <player_name> permission set ptero.autostart.<server_name>
            # All players can start all servers
            /lp group default permission set ptero.autostart.*
            ```
            ※ `<player_name>` refers to the player's name, `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
    - Use built-in permission settings.
        1. Open `config.yml`.
        2. Add the following settings to the `config.yml` file.
            ```yml
            permissions:
                default:
                # All players can start all server
                - ptero.autostart.*
                # All players can start specific server
                - ptero.autostart.<server_name>
            ```  
            ※ `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
        3. Restart the BungeeCord server.
  
## Usage

### Automatic Startup

- Servers will automatically start when players attempt to join each server on BungeeCord.
    - This feature is available only to players with the `ptero.autostart.<server_name>` permission.

### Manual Start/Stop

- Use the `/ptero start <server_name>` command to manually start a server.
    - This command is available only to players with the `ptero.start.<server_name>` permission.
- Use the `/ptero stop <server_name>` command to manually stop a server.
    - This command is available only to players with the `ptero.stop.<server_name>` permission.

※ `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.

### Reloading config.yml/Language files

- Use `/ptero reload` to reload the config.yml and language files.

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file includes the following settings, but not all items need to be configured.

### Required Settings

- `pterodactyl`: Refer to [Using Panels Other Than Pterodactyl > Panel Settings](#panel-settings).
- `servers`: Configure settings for each server. Set the server ID and the time until automatic shutdown.
    - `id`: Set the server ID on Pterodactyl.
        - Server IDs on Pterodactyl can be found in the URL of the server page.
        - For example, if the URL is https://panel.example.com/server/1234abcd, the server ID is 1234abcd.

### Optional Settings

- `version`: Set the version of the plugin.
    - When updating the plugin, a warning will be displayed if this value does not match the plugin version.
    - A `config.new.yml` file will be generated, and manual migration of settings using a merge tool is required.
    - After migration, please change this value to the new version.
- `checkUpdate`: Set whether to check for plugin updates. The default is `true`.
- `language`: Set the language to be used. The default is English (`en`).
    - Refer to the comments in the [config file](./src/main/resources/config.yml) for supported languages.
- `startTimeout`: After starting a server with this plugin, it will stop the server if there are no players for a certain period. The unit is seconds.
    - After starting, the server will stop after the `startTimeout` plus the server's timeout duration.
    - Setting it to 1 keeps the server running until players join and leave.
- `powerControllerType`: Set the type of power controller to be used.
    - The built-in PowerController currently supports only `pterodactyl`, which operates Pterodactyl.
    - By adding add-ons, you can add your own custom PowerController.
      Certainly! Here's the English translation of the provided description:
- `useSynchronousPing`: This setting determines whether to perform **synchronous** pinging to the server during login. (Experimental feature)
    - When enabled, pinging the server during login will happen synchronously rather than asynchronously.
    - This allows displaying BungeePteroPower messages (`join_autostart_login` in messages.yml) instead of the "Could not connect to a default or fallback server" message upon login.
    - The default value is `false`. Enabling this can be useful if you want to set servers (such as lobby servers) to a suspended state in BungeePteroPower immediately after login.
- `customHeaders`: Custom HTTP headers
    - Can be used for purposes such as authentication headers or reverse proxies.
    - Specify in the format `Key: Value`.
- `startupJoin`: After server startup, it is used to automatically join players to the server and check the server's status.
    - `timeout`: Set the maximum waiting time for players to join after server startup.
        - Set this value to the maximum time it takes for the server to start.
        - Setting it to 0 disables this feature, and players will not automatically join after startup.
    - `joinDelay`: Once the server is pingable, wait the specified amount of seconds before sending the player to the server
        - This is useful to wait for plugins like Luckperms to fully load
        - If you set it to 0, the player will be connected as soon as the server is pingable
    - `pingInterval`: Set the interval for checking the server's status.
- `restoreOnStop`: Configure settings for the feature to reset the server from a backup when it is stopped.
    - `timeout`: Set the maximum waiting time after sending the stop signal for the server to stop. (The restore will be performed after the server stops)
    - `pingInterval`: Set the interval for checking if the server is offline after sending the stop signal.
- `servers`: Configure settings for each server. Set the server ID and the time until automatic shutdown.
    - `timeout`: When there are no players on the server, it will stop after a certain period. The unit is seconds.
    - `backupId`: The UUID of the backup to restore when the server stops.
        - If this setting is empty or removed, no restore from backup will be performed when the server stops.
        - Useful for servers that need to be reset after each game.

### Using Panels Other Than Pterodactyl

The built-in PowerController supports the following:
- `pterodactyl`: https://pterodactyl.io/
- `crafty`: https://craftycontrol.com/

In addition to the built-in options, you can add your own custom PowerController by creating an add-on.

#### Panel Settings

- `powerControllerType`: Set the type of PowerController to use.
    - Specify options such as `pterodactyl` or `crafty`.
- `pterodactyl`: Configure settings for Pterodactyl, including URL and API key.
    - `url`: Set the URL of your Pterodactyl panel. (Example: https://panel.example.com/)
        - If you are using services like Cloudflare Tunnel, ensure proper bypass settings for IP-based communication.
    - `apiKey`: Set the client API key for Pterodactyl.
        - It begins with `ptlc_`.
        - Client API keys for Pterodactyl can be found in the "API Credentials" tab on the account page.
- `crafty`: Configure settings for the Crafty Controller. Set the URL and API key. The configuration items are the same as those for Pterodactyl.

### Permission Settings

BungeePteroPower plugin allows fine-grained control over commands available to players for each server using permissions.

- `ptero.autostart.<server_name>`: Servers will automatically start when players join each server on BungeeCord for players with this permission.
- `ptero.start.<server_name>`: Allows the `/ptero start <server_name>` command to manually start a server.
    - If a player doesn't have `ptero.autostart.<server_name>` permission but has this permission, they will see a manual start button when they join the server.
- `ptero.stop.<server_name>`: Allows the `/ptero stop <server_name>` command to manually stop a server.
- `ptero.reload`: Allows the `/ptero reload` command to reload the config.

※ `<server_name>` refers to the server name specified in BungeeCord's `config.yml`.
※ Specify `*` for `<server_name>` to apply permissions to all servers.

### About Language Files

- You can set the language in config.yml using the language option.
    - Please refer to the comments in the config file for the supported languages.
- Upon startup, a file for the language set in config.yml will be generated.
    - This file allows you to define only the messages you want to change.
    - Messages that are not defined will be loaded from the language file set within the plugin.
- You can edit and then reload the plugin's language by using the `/ptero reload` command.
- Contributions via Pull Requests for additional language files are welcome.

## Information for Plugin Developers

### About Power Controllers

BungeePteroPower provides a Power Controller API for supporting platforms other than Pterodactyl.  
By creating add-ons, you can add power controllers for platforms other than Pterodactyl!

We also welcome pull requests for adding built-in power controllers!  
Ideally, we would like to support the following:
- Power controllers that can start servers locally
- Power controllers compatible with management software other than Pterodactyl.  
    For example, we would like to support the following:
    - PufferPanel
    - Minecraft Server Manager
    - MCSManager
    - MC Server Soft
    - AMP

### Creating Add-ons

- BungeePteroPower provides an API for integration with other plugins.
    - If you want to support platforms other than Pterodactyl, it is possible by implementing the API.
- You can use the BungeePteroPower API by adding dependencies.

        ```
    4. Use the API:
        ```java
        import com.kamesuta.bungeepteropower.api.BungeePteroPowerAPI;

        public class YourPlugin extends JavaPlugin {
            @Override
            public void onEnable() {
                // Get an instance of BungeePteroPowerAPI
                BungeePteroPowerAPI api = BungeePteroPowerAPI.getInstance();
                // Register your custom PowerController
                api.registerPowerController("your_service", new YourPowerController());
            }
        }
        ```
