# Perform synchronous pinging to the server during login. (Experimental feature)
# When enabled, pinging the server during login will happen synchronously rather than asynchronously.
# This allows displaying BungeePteroPower messages instead of the "Could not connect to a default or fallback server" message upon login.
# The default value is `false`. Enabling this can be useful if you want to set servers (such as lobby servers) to a suspended state in BungeePteroPower immediately after login.
